## What did you build?
### I built and escape room games where you are stuck in an AI simulation and you have to complete a series
### of mini games before your mind gets curropted by the AI.
## What language(s) or tools did you use?
### This game was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
## Which AI tools did you use, and how?
### I used chatgpt and Cursor AI. I used chatgpt to create an outline for the project.
### I told chatgpt the idea that I had for the project and told to give me an outline for the project.
### I then copied the outline and put it into cursor ai which helped make the idea come to life.
### Obviously it didn't come out like I wanted it to so I had to do a little bit of cleaning up.
## What did you do versus what AI helped with?
### AI helped me build the skeleton and I just had to fix some errors and change it the way I wanted it to look.
### Sometimes AI doesnt do what you tell it to, so you have to manually go in there read the code and fix it based on how you want it to look.
## What’s one thing you’re proud of?
### One thing that I am proud of is how the website/game looks. It took a while but I got the whole website to look like a HACK theme.
### There was also cool little mini games although some of them are a little annoying. But I like the idea behind it.
## What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
### If I had a little bit more time I would most likely fix the background, There are these random number that show up(that I like) however there
### is also and circle that shoes up with the numbers. I belive it would look cooler without the circle. The background in of it self needs some love.
### I also couldnt get the progress bar to work so maybe fix that up as well.
